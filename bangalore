My first visit to this city has been a bitter sweet experience. The good part is that this new city gives me a sense of freedom 
which I have not experienced before but it also makes me feel very lonely because everybody is new to me. I hope 
livign here turns out to be a good learning experience above all otherwise i would like to go back to my den which is north and
live with my family.
This is funny because I have to write this extra line only because I am learning github
I don't know why am I becoming bitter to other people. What have I learnt from this experience is that people are impatient 
and they don't care. What should I do in this scenario. I should start focusing on myself because that is the most important thing
