My first visit to this city has been a bitter sweet experience. The good part is that this new city gives me a sense of freedom 
which I have not experienced before but it also makes me feel very lonely because everybody is new to me. I hope 
livign here turns out to be a good learning experience above all otherwise i would like to go back to my den which is north and
live with my family.
